### Cost Control - 
- Azure operates on a pay-as-you-go model. Without proper monitoring and management, costs can easily spiral out of control. Cost optimization ensures that you get the most value for your money.

### Waste Reduction & Improved Performance: 
- Optimization can help to identify unused or underutilized resources, helping to reduce waste and improve overall efficiency and performance.
  
### Resource Scalability 
 - Proper optimization can ensure your business is ready to scale when it needs to, preventing potential future headaches.
 
### Budget Predictability
 - With optimization, you can better predict your Azure costs, making budget planning easier.
 
### Right-sizing 
- If you're using more resources than required, you can downsize to save costs. Similarly, you can upscale resources based on demand.

### Decommission/ Shutdown Unused Resources: 
- Decom and Stop/Pause the resources when not actively being used. 

### Reserved VM Instances & Savings Plan 
- both cost saving options from Microsoft that allow customers to get a significant discount over pay-as-you-go costs in return for committing to a long-term contract (typically 1 or 3 years).

### Use Cost Management Tools and Budgets
- Use Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor to get insights into your spending. Set up budgets and alerts to prevent overspending and get recommendations on reducing costs.


Key Findings:
Tool mainly focused on costly and low risk resourcetypes to identify for cost saving opportunity.

Few resourcetypes listed here with different status findings

### App Service Plan (ASP) –Findings
- ASP without any webapps/slots 
- ASP with Webapps/slots stopped in state for long time
- ASP with Only Function Apps – Without any Functions in It
- ASP with Only Function Apps has function - No function execution for long time
- ASP rightsizing

### Application Gateway (AAG) –Findings
- AAG withut backend pool target configured -> anomolies
- AAG without any success/Redirection traffic -> No 2xx/3xx httpsstatuscode
- AAG located in DR region - applicable for active:passive infra -> can be stopped if no traffic and can be enabled when DR test needed

### Power BI embedded capacity
- Power BI without any utilization
- Power BI needs SKU Right Sizing

### Single SQL Database
- Idle SQL Databases 
- SQL Database needs DTU Right Sizing
- SQL Database needs vCore Right Sizing
- SQL Database needs migration from DTU to vCore

### SQL Elastic Pools (SEP)
- Idle SEP with DBs 
- SEP needs DTU Right Sizing
- SEP needs vCore Right Sizing
- SEP needs migration from DTU to vCore

### Managed Disks
- Azure Managed disks unattached

## General Recommendations and best Practice for Cost Optimization
### Conservative:
 -  ScaleDown the resources SKU to the next least level to reduce the cost
 -  Use Stop/Pause feature (if available) to take immediate Cost reduction

### Aggressive:
- Initiate the Decommissioning of the resource after safety Cool OFF process

### Collateral Remediations:
- Depended Components or Entire resources groups can be decommed, If the Major components from the resourcegroup is deleted.
