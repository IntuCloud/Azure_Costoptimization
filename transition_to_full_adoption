#### There are several steps to onboard a client and transition them from interest to full adoption. Here's a typical process you might follow:

1. *Client Feedback & Proposal Refinement*: Gather feedback from the demo, address any concerns, and refine the proposal if needed, ensuring the product matches their needs.

2. *Negotiation & Agreement*: Finalize pricing, terms, and conditions with the client. This often involves legal reviews and formalizing contracts or agreements.

3. *Purchase Order (PO) or Contract Signing*: The client officially commits by signing a contract or providing a purchase order, outlining the agreed terms.

4. *Onboarding Planning*: Develop a detailed onboarding plan, which includes key timelines, training, and resources needed. Identify points of contact and set up a communication plan.

5. *Implementation & Integration*: Start product deployment or setup. This may involve configuring the product to fit the clientâ€™s environment, integrating with their systems, and any necessary customization.

6. *Training & Documentation*: Provide client training sessions on how to use the product, including access to guides, tutorials, or dedicated customer support.

7. *Testing & Quality Assurance*: Ensure the product works correctly in the client's environment through testing. Any issues found are resolved before the full go-live.

8. *Go-Live & Handover*: Once everything is in place and the client is satisfied, the product goes live. Final handovers take place, including final documentation and full access to product features.

9. *Support & Follow-Up*: Provide post-go-live support to address any issues or questions. Regular check-ins ensure the client is satisfied and using the product effectively.
